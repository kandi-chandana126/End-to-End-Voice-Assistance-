End to End AI Voice Assistance Pipeline

A pipeline that takes a voice query command, converts it into text, uses a LargeLanguage Model (LLM) to generate a response, and then converts the output text back into
speech. The system should have low latency, Voice Activity Detection (VAD), restrict theoutput to 2 sentences, and allow for tunable parameters such as pitch, male/female voice,
and speed.
